/**
 * Now in this part, we will look on how to solve the general problems using the recursion with memoization.
 */

/**
 * 1. make it work.No matter how long it might take.
 *    a. Visualize the problem as tree.
 *    b. Implement the tree using recursion. Imagine the leaves of the tree as base cases.
 *    c. Test it
 * 2. make it efficient
 *    a. add a memo object
 *    b. add a base case to return the memo values( so need to remove duplication)
 *    c. store return values into the memo
